CAmkES is a component platform for seL4. This directory contains files related
to a formal Isabelle model of CAmkES.

 adl-spec/ - Architectural model.
 code/ - AutoCorres-based work (bottom-up approach to glue code).
 glue-spec/ - Behavioural model (top-down approach to glue code).
 misc/ - What it says on the box.

FIXME:
 - I removed CAmkES exceptions from the model. Not sure if they really make
   sense, but if they do they'll need to be re-introduced.
 - The explicit concept of a connector is absent from the types. It may
   help to add this later.
 - Unidirectional shared memory communication and more than two parties should
   be supported.
 - Components should be allowed to have a configuration as well.
 - Attributes need some work. They basically have no type information at the
   implementation level which is a bit of a minefield.
 - There needs to be a nice way of hiding arch-specific connectors. Perhaps
   this should be generalised into a way of fail-stopping assemblies that
   involve platform connectors that are unavailable.
